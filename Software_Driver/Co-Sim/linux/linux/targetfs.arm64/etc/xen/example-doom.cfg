# Example PV Linux guest configuration
# =====================================================================
#
# This is a fairly minimal example of what is required for a
# Paravirtualised Linux guest. For a more complete guide see xl.cfg(5)

# Guest name
name = "guest1"

# 128-bit UUID for the domain as a hexadecimal number.
# Use "uuidgen" to generate one if required.
# The default behavior is to generate a new UUID each time the guest is started.
#uuid = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Kernel image to boot
kernel = "/boot/Image"

# Ramdisk (optional)
#ramdisk = "/boot/initrd.gz"

# Kernel command line options
extra = "console=hvc0 rdinit=/doom.sh"

# Initial memory allocation (MB)
memory = 256

# Maximum memory (MB)
# If this is greater than `memory' then the slack will start ballooned
# (this assumes guest kernel support for ballooning)
#maxmem = 512

# Number of VCPUS
vcpus = 1

# Virtual Frame Buffer
vfb = [ 'type=vnc, vnclisten=0.0.0.0' ]
