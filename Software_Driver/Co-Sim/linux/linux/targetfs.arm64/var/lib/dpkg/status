Description: Library for manipulating C and Unicode strings
 Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may consist of
 very different scripts from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi with many
 kinds of special characters accents, right-to-left writing marks,
 hyphens, Roman numbers, and much more. But the POSIX platform APIs for
 text do not contain adequate functions for dealing with particular
 properties of many Unicode characters. In fact, the POSIX APIs for text
 have several assumptions at their base which don't hold for Unicode text.
 This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and for
 manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.  This package
 contains documentation.

 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
 single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of
 the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The
 utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-
 featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the
 expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.
 BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or

 Initscripts provide the basic system startup initialization scripts for

Description: Tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities in a single small executable
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
 single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of
 the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The
 utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-
 featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the
 expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.
 BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or
 embedded system.
