Xilinx libremote-port
---------------------------------------
Remote-Port (RP) is an inter-simulator protocol. It assumes a reliable
point to point communcation with the remote simulation environment.

Setup
---------------------------------------
In the SETUP phase a mandatory HELLO packet is exchanged with optional
CFG packets following. HELLO packets are useful to ensure that both
sides are speaking the same protocol and using compatible versions.

CFG packets are used to negotiate configuration options. At the moment
these remain unimplemented.

Once the session is up, communication can start through various other
commands. The list can be found in the source code.

Commands are carried over RP packets. Every RP packet contains a header
with length, flags and an ID to track potential responses.

The header is followed by a packet specific payload. You'll find the
details of the various commands packet layouts in the source code.
Some commands can carry data/blobs in their payload.
